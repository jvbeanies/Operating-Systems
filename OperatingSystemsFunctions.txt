One awesome operating sysyem function is the ability to perform automatic updates.  This is an increbily useful feature that can save people many time.  This function also prevents any possbile issues with outdated software.
Another operation system function is the ability to connect to thr internet.  Without the ability to do so many computersa and devices loose complete functionality.  This is a critical function that must work.  
The most importatn operating system function is the ability to create a unique username and password.  This gives you clear control and acess to your computer.  This function also provides an important layer of security to your personal device.  I highly recommend everyone use a strong username and password on your persoanl devices.
